    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    For the final project was trying to create a cloud connected thermostat.  It was writing code for a device that could take a set temperature, read the current temperature, and toggle on or off a heating/cooling system.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    I feel that for within these projets I succeeded in creating clean concise code.
    
    Where could you improve?
    I think while working on these projects I could have had more effective modularity.
    
This whole project helped me develop skills to learning new components quickly and read through it's appropriate documentation.  Each week we were learning a different component of the board which functions wholy different from the previous component.  Ultimately however it led to me feeling like I could pick up a piece of hardware and learn how it functions much faster now.
